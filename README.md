# CNN-LSTM
A novel intelligent deep learning predictive model for meteorological drought forecasting.

This code is written in Python 3.4 software and simulated in Anaconda environment. Keras libraries are called first. 
Then, we read our data in Excel and separate it into the training and testing sets.
In the next stage, the model and model parameters are imported.
Finally, by compiling the model, the prediction error is evaluated and displayed in separate figures.
